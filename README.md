# Transit Dashboard

### Purpose

This application enables the user to view customized information about the Washington DC area public transit system.  

### Function

After registering on the site, the user can select bus stops, train stations, and bikeshare docks that they would like to be informed about.  Accordingly, arrival times for routes at those stations and availability of bicycles appear on the page, enabling the user to plan their trip.

### Notes

This transit dashboard was created as part of a class project, wherein the amount of time we were given was purposely limited; accordingly, not all features are completely functional.  However, making requests to the WMATA and Capital Bikeshare APIs does generate formatted JSON data, and many elements of the front end portion are complete as well.
